# CO Whitewater Scraper

## Overview

This app scrapes the https://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/River/state-summary/state/CO/ site which used to look crappy, but actually just improved!  However, this app isolates just the Colorado river sections as well as enables saving favorites and adding notes.
